<!--
  Backend complexity is out of control, and the amount of work needed by
  developers to built professional, scalable, backend applications is rising not
  falling. Applications should be about business logic, instead our teams are
  working on serverless, kubernetes, dev-production parity, database
  maintenance, migrations, babysitting servers and orchestrating fleets of
  containers.

  What's wrong with backend?

  Infra complexity

  Deployment Complexity

  Development complexity (envs, toolchains, compilers, build, devcontainers, parse errors, collaboration, git, vim config, formatting, linters)

  kubernetes AWS dev-containers node_modules docker devops ci/cd terraform yaml
  provisioning schema-migrations DB-locks sql nosql service-meshes linters
  language-server-protocol vscode-packages vim-config docker-compose IAM servers
  serverless linux kernels bash ports networking compilers build-systems

  Darklang is a project to remove all the *accidental complexity* from 
  backend applications. It's a language designed for cloud backends, to solve the
  problems of professional backend developers, based on industry best practices.

  Darklang removes infrastructure complexity by running the infrastructure for
  you. Darklang removes deployment complexity by having instant, 50ms
  deployments and a language and environment designed to make this safe.
  Darklang solves development complexity with innovative, always-on debugging,
  language and library versioning, with databases, workers and feature flags
  built into the language.

  ---
  
  BUT: Darklang is still early. It works, mostly. The new
  technology--deployless, trace driven design--is proven, but doesn't scale yet.
  The language is nice, but incomplete. The editor is interesting but glitchy.
  The tools you expect from existing languages, such as packages and SDKs for
  every vendor under the sun, don't exist. Not even a good user/account
  management solution. We're a lot of work to do.
  
  You can use Darklang today. You can have instant deployment and infrastructure
  and people use it to build real applications, But I want to set expectations:
  **it can be really annoying** and you copy-and-paste something wrong, when you
  discover you need to implement some OAuth connection yourself, or when you see
  our janky type checking situation in a supposedly staticly-typed language.
  
  As we discuss features below, we'll include a frank assessment of where they are.



  --- What is Darklang?

  Combination of language, editor, and cloud, designed to avoid this complexity. Features:

  List all the features

  No infra

  Deployless

  DB stuff

  Error Rail/ no excepions

  Live values

  Trace-driven development

  package management

  version control

  testing

  type checking

  version control

  multi-player

  Our language is designed to make it hard to make mistakes
  - fully immutable
  - no nulls
  - no exceptions
  - statically types (with Rust-like enums)




  --- Good users for Darklang

  - 1-3 people
  - need a very small set of SDKs
  - uses storage, HTTP, 


  ---

  But Dark is bad?

  Lots


  live values SAY MORE
  trace driven development SAY MORE - build up computation from requests that happened IN THE PAST
  itomic, nstant, deployment, the most continuous of deployments SAY MORE

  omg Paul this sounds amazing, is there a catch? 
  Of course there's a catch. Darklang isn't good yet.
  
  So far we've proven that our core ideas work, and that you can build apps without any of this complexity.
  
  But alas, there are problems:
  - the editor can be tough to learn, frustrating, and sometimes buggy. Writing new code isn't bad, but editing existing code isn't fun
  - the ecosystem is threadbare: we only have a small handful of 2rdparty integrations, and they're very minor. You will very likely have to write some HTTP-based code to use vendor APIs. There's no user module in particular.
  - 

  But, you can help! Darklang is source available, developed in the open by a tiny but dedicated full-time team. Our issue tracker has...


  Can I use Darklang today?

  Yes, of course -> GET STARTED. Just promise me that you're aware of the frustration.

  Can I contribute to Dark?

  If you use dark, you should definitely contribute! Fixes to the editor, standard library functions, ideas for new features, support for new types. If you're willing to help, we're very willing to help you help us, writing guides, contributor docs, and even 1-on-1 pairing. 

  We especially appreciate contributions from folks using Dark, as they solve real problems our users are experiencing.

  
  
  Darklang is incomplete, and using it can be frustrating.


 
  Still, Darklang is pretty usable for:
  - non-mission critical work
  - small REST/JSON based projects
  - reasonably data and scaling requirements
  - 1 developers, maybe 2-3

                  Development environments and tooling are typically configured piecemeal, with dozens of tools
                  interacting--often badly--to make up a development environment. It is not uncommon for simple projects
                  to involve dozens of tools: devcontainers, formatters, linters, build systems, package managers,
                  compilers, and dependency management, and that's before we come to disparate editors and operating

              Darklang doesn't have any of this complexity. Instead, you just write code that's instantly available in
              production. It does so by <span class="font-bold">combining a programming language, editor, and hosted
                cloud infrastructure</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
              This combination allows us to completely cut out <span class="font-bold">infrastructure complexity</span>.
              We handle servers, databases and workers, all instantly available without having to write yaml, build
              containers, or any of the overhead of configuring cloud infrastructute.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
              <span class="font-bold">Deployment complexity</span> is removed because Darklang is designed for instant
              deployment. Instead of a complex CI/CD pipeline, or packaging and deploying containers, each tiny change
              made in the Darklang editor is instantly deployed. All parts of Darklang are designed to make this safe,
              from built-in feature flags, AST-based code storage, support for and the language is designed to make this
              safe.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
              Similarly, Darklang's <span class="font-bold">development environment</span> requires no setup. All
              tooling is integrated into the editor and cloud, and no steps are required to create or maintain it. No
              devcontainers or build systems or complex tooling.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
              Finally, in addition to removing all this complexity, Darklang's combination of editor, language and
              infrastructure allows features that do not exist elsewhere, such as <span class="font-bold italic">live
                values</span>, <span class="font-bold italic">Trace-Driven Development</span>, and <span

            <p class="mt-5 text-lg text-gray-300">
              Darklang has a long way to go to fulfil all its promise. The infrastructure part works, the deployless
              works but does not have nearly all the features needed to make it safe, the editor is janky and buggy, and
              the language is incomplete as well. And most importantly, Darklang doesn't yet for
              support for the hundreds of thousands of packages and SDKs that you might be used to in Node or Python or
              Go. Not even a user/account package.

            <p class="mt-5 text-lg text-gray-300">
              Darklang is built by Dark Inc, with 2 fulltime engineers working on it. We haven't gotten to product
              market fit yet, and we believe that Darklang is not really <span class="italic">good</span>. It's cool,
              it's interesting, it's got a lot of properties that frankly other languages and environments should steal,
              but it's not actually <span class="italic">good</span> yet.

            <p class="mt-5 text-lg text-gray-300">
              We are confident it will get there, and you are welcome to try Darklang out, and even build things in it.
              You'll likely find it eye-opening, liberating, and quite frustrating.
